/*Hello, and welcome to the npm adventure workshop!  I am going to be
asking you to do various things with npm so that you can get started
with it easily.

Some helpful commands:

npm help ............ Get help with npm
how-to-npm print .... Re-display the current exercise
how-to-npm verify ... Verify that you have finished an exercise
how-to-npm solution . Show the solution for the current exercise

The first thing we're going to do is make sure that your npm
version is up to date.

Run `how-to-npm verify` once that is done.

(This is the only part of the workshop that requires network access.
If the network is busted, and you want to skip this one, you can run
`how-to-npm verify skip` to skip it.)*/
/*
02 Log In
npm is best when you can be a part of it.  That starts with
creating an account.

Because this is just a tutorial adventure, remember, we're not
*actually* creating an account anywhere.  However, when you run
this in the Real World, it'll create a real account, with a page
on npmjs.com and the ability to publish packages that real live
humans can install and enjoy.

To see who you're logged in as, run `npm whoami`

To create your account, run `npm adduser`

Try it now, and open the door to ever-greater module fun times!
Then run `how-to-npm verify`

Congratulations, cannelflow!
You are the proud owner of an imaginary new npm account!
Use it wisely.  Never in anger.  Always for the Good.

With this sweet power comes much responsibility, which is
sufficiently different from Spiderman's thing that Marvel
hopefully won't sue us.

Excelsior!

/*
03 Start A Project
npm helps you build projects, but for npm to be able to do that, you need
to tell npm a little bit about your project. You can tell npm about your
project in a file called package.json.

Run `npm init --scope=<username>`, and replace <username> with the user
you created in the last lesson. This will create a package.json file.
(For extra credit, set the project up with a git repo as well.)

Run `how-to-npm verify` once you're done.
