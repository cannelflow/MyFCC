Write a route that extracts data from query string in the GET '/search' URL
route, e.g. ?results=recent&include_tabs=true and then outputs it back to
the user in JSON format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

In Express.js to extract query string parameters, we can use:

    req.query.NAME

To output JSON we can use:

    res.send(object)
