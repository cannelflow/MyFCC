One of the most important things that npm does is install packages.

However, in order to be a good workshop program, we don't want to litter
files all over your computer, so before going any further, let's set up a
development environment.

Make a new directory and `cd` into it.

Run `how-to-npm verify` once you're done.  All the other commands
you run in this tutorial should be done in that folder.
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ how-to-npm verify
Congratulations!
You have a development environment.

From here on out, make sure to run the workshop in this dir

You might notice that a `.npmrc` file will show up in there.
That normaly would not be required, but the workshop uses it
to mock out the parts that would normally talk to the internet.
