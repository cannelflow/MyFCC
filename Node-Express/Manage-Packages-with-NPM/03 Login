npm is best when you can be a part of it.  That starts with
creating an account.

Because this is just a tutorial adventure, remember, we're not
*actually* creating an account anywhere.  However, when you run
this in the Real World, it'll create a real account, with a page
on npmjs.com and the ability to publish packages that real live
humans can install and enjoy.

To see who you're logged in as, run `npm whoami`

To create your account, run `npm adduser`

Try it now, and open the door to ever-greater module fun times!
Then run `how-to-npm verify`
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ npm whoami

Congratulations, cannelflow!
You are the proud owner of an imaginary new npm account!
Use it wisely.  Never in anger.  Always for the Good.

With this sweet power comes much responsibility, which is
sufficiently different from Spiderman's thing that Marvel
hopefully won't sue us.

Excelsior!
