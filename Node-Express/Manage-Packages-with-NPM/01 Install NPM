Hello, and welcome to the npm adventure workshop!  I am going to be
asking you to do various things with npm so that you can get started
with it easily.

Some helpful commands:

npm help ............ Get help with npm
how-to-npm print .... Re-display the current exercise
how-to-npm verify ... Verify that you have finished an exercise
how-to-npm solution . Show the solution for the current exercise

The first thing we're going to do is make sure that your npm
version is up to date.

Run `how-to-npm verify` once that is done.

(This is the only part of the workshop that requires network access.
If the network is busted, and you want to skip this one, you can run
`how-to-npm verify skip` to skip it.)
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ napm install -g how-to-npm
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ how-to-npm verify
verifying that npm is installed...
You have version 2.15.1 installed.  Great!
Now let's see what the latest version is... wait for it...
The latest npm is: 3.8.8
You have version 2.15.1, but the latest is 3.8.8
Run `npm install npm -g` to upgrade it
(You can also just skip this if you want)
