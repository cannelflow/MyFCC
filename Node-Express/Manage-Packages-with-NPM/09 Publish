What good is a package manager without packages?

Not very good.

Luckily, that is not a problem for npm, because it's very easy for all
npm users to publish their modules and share them with the world.

Packages get into the registry by using the `npm publish` command.

Try it now.  There's not much too it.

(Make sure you're still in the right project directory, though.  If you
publish something by mistake, you can remove it, but there's no guarantee
that no one saw it in the meantime.)

Then run `how-to-npm verify` when you're done.
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ npm publish
+ @cannelflow/workspace@1.0.0
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ how-to-npm verify
In order to view your package content, I just ran this command:

  npm view @cannelflow/workspace

Run that command yourself to see what it prints out.


The `npm view` command is a great way to view package details,
to see what you just published, and to check if a name is already taken.

Now that you've published your first package here in make-believe npm
workshop land, go out and write a real thing to share with real humans!

You don't have to just share code for other people, though.  There are
also benefits to breaking up your code into small manageable pieces, even
if you are only using them all yourself.

You can imagine that your future self and your past self are the two
other developers on your team.  (Scheduling meetings is pretty tricky.)

Run `how-to-npm` to go on to the next adventure!
