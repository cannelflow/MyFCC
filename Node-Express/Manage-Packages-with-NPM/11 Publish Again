Publishing something once is fine.  But healthy packages get
published again and again with new and exciting bug fixes.

You can't re-use the same version number again, because that's hella
confusing for all the robots running the treadmills that power the npm
registry.  But, now that we changed the version number in the last
exercise, you can publish the package again.

Go for it!  Then get your prize with `how-to-npm verify`
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ npm publish
+ @cannelflow/workspace@1.0.1
cannelflow1:~/workspace $ how-to-npm verify
Wow!  You are well on your way to becoming a regular
TJames "Substack" Halidaychuk!  There's no stopping you!
Run `how-to-npm` to go to the next step.
